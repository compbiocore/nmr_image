## Overview

NMRdock is a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container image for processing raw NMR time domain data into frequency domain spectra and analyzing the spectra. The image includes [NMRPipe](https://www.ibbr.umd.edu/nmrpipe/index.html) and [NMRFAM-Sparky](https://nmrfam.wisc.edu/nmrfam-sparky-distribution/) for processing and analysis, respectively. NMRdock can be installed on any operating system (OSX, Windows, or Linux) and has the full functionality of both NMRPipe and NMRFAM-Sparky.
