The image includes NMRPipe and NMRFAM-Sparky for processing and analysis, respectively. NMRdock can be installed on any operating system (OSX, Windows, or Linux) and has the full functionality of both NMRPipe and NMRFAM-Sparky. For guides on processing BioNMR data in NMRdock, please access our Walkthrough Section Quick Start Scripts Below are quick start scripts for OSX, Linux, and Windows (For detailed Installation Instructions, please see the Installation Guides below). Click on your operating system to access the script. Right click and save the script as either macQS.sh , linuxQS.sh , or windowQS.bat . The scripts will make sure that you have the necessary components installed; if not, it will tell you how to install them. If you have everything installed, the script will start NMRdock. Installation Guides Reporting Issues To report any issues, request the addition of features, or suggestions; please submit an issue to the Github for the developers to respond.

NMRdock is able to access your computer through /home/ubuntu/data . For the purposes of this tutorial, we are going to use the test data by typing into the command line: cd /home/ubuntu/test/bruker2D Once we are in the folder with our data, type the command bruker and the bruker command window will open up. Read in the parameters by pressing the Read Parameters button. Check to make sure that the parameters were read in correctly and update any values that need to be updated. Then press Save Script followed by Execute Script and the script will be executed to convert your Bruker formatted data into NMRPipe. You can then close the window and return to the command line. To Fourier Transform the data, execute ./nmrproc.com in the command line. Now we can view the processed spectrum in NMRDraw by executing nmrDraw , which will open up the nmrDraw window (this can take a few seconds). If you are using your own data, you can phase and alter the nmrproc.com file yourself at this point. However, the nmrproc.com file for the included bruker data is already phased properly. Once the data is phased to your liking, you can close the NMRDraw window and return to the command line. Congratulations! Your NMR spectrum is now processed. To convert the NMRPipe processed spectrum to the universal UCSF format, execute pipe2ucsf test.ft2 bruker2D.ucsf . You can then open the spectrum in sparky by executing sparky bruker2D.ucsf . Docker Installation Docker engine for Mac , Windows (Home) , Windows (Pro, Educational, Enterprise) , and Linux must be downloaded and installed in order to run the Docker Image. NOTE: Docker Desktop does NOT work on Windows 10 Home Edition. Windows 10 Home Edition requires Docker Toolbox. OSX To run this image on OSX, a few steps must be taken to enable X11 interfacing between the container and the host machine. This requires the installation of XQuartz . Install Docker Desktop Use Homebrew or MacPorts to install socat : brew install socat or sudo port install socat With socat installed, open a terminal window and type: socat TCP-LISTEN:6000,reuseaddr,fork UNIX-CLIENT:\\\"$DISPLAY\\\" Leave the socat window open and open a new tab in terminal. Run the docker image by typing: docker run -it -v [path to a directory on local computer]:/home/ubuntu/data/ -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -e DISPLAY=x.x.x.x:0 compbiocore/nmrdock:latest /bin/bash where x.x.x.x is given by ifconfig getifaddr en0 and [path to a directory on local computer] can be set to your `pwd` or the directory of your data. To use the development branch NMRdock, replace latest with dev . This can be done with the following script command: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 #!/bin/csh open -a \"Terminal\" osascript -e 'tell application \"Terminal\" to do script \"socat TCP-LISTEN:6000,reuseaddr,fork UNIX-CLIENT:\\\\\\\"$DISPLAY\\\\\\\"\"' set A = ` ipconfig getifaddr en0 ` set C = \":0 compbiocore/nmrdock:latest /bin/bash\" set B = \"docker run -it -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -v `pwd`:/home/ubuntu/data/ -w /home/ubuntu/data/ -e DISPLAY=$A$C\" exec $B Windows To run this image on Windows, a few steps must be taken to enable X11 interfacing between the container and the host machine. This requires the installation of VcXsrv Windows XServer . Install Docker for Windows 7/8/10 Home or 10 Pro/Educational/Enterprise . Open XLaunch by double clicking on the Desktop Icon. A window will appear for you to set configurations. Use the default options on the first two pages by pressing the next button. On the third page, select the box next \"Disable access control\" to ensure that the Docker has access to the XServer. Get your IP address using ipconfig. This can be done in Command Line or Powershell Open Docker and execute docker run -it -v /c/:/home/ubuntu/data/ -e DISPLAY=x.x.x.x:0.0 compbiocore/nmrdock:latest /bin/bash where x.x.x.x is your IP address. To use the development branch NMRdock, replace latest with dev . Linux Most Linux distros have a native XServer that can be accessed by Docker. Install Docker for your distribution of Linux docker run -it -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -v [path to a directory on local computer]:/home/ubuntu/data/ compbiocore/nmrdock:latest /bin/bash To use the development branch NMRdock, replace latest with dev .","title":"Walkthroughs"},{"location":"walkthroughs/#nmrdock-walkthrough","text":"","title":"NMRdock Walkthrough"},{"location":"walkthroughs/#using-nmrpipe-to-process-bruker-data-in-nmrdock","text":"Change the directory into your dataset.
